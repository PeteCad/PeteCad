- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PeteCad
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
- :horse: I'm an older tech head. My first programming language was Fortran 77, well, technically it was binary as I programed some "HERO" robots back when heathkit was a thing. Back in school I learned Miranda, various C flavours when object oriented programing was new, Pascal, and a bunch of others I'm sure I forget. But I've been out of the coding world for a long time now as my main employment revolves around electronics and RF. Been thinking I need to upgrade some skills since even all the old RF stuff is getting more and more integrated with networks and so forth. Did Tim's most recent "program a game in python" and it was a blast to see how much libraries have improved and little everything else has changed.
